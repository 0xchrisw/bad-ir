# Bad IR - *Work in Progress*
Keystroke Injection on Smart TVs


---


IR is great, and has a fair amount of applicable applications, but is controlling a networked device one of them?

The goal of this project is to execute untrusted code on a Smart TV. Using a combination of both IR and ADB commands, as well as HTTP methods, we intend to enable privileged access in order to install/side-load applications and give us a pivot into internal networks.
